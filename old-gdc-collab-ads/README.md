- will write this more coherently later...

# Setting Up

1. Execute `initialize.yag` one time through YAGPDB's CC dashboard and Discord. If you cannot execute the whole command due to the character limit, split up the CC into two.
2. Add `submitmedia.yag` through YAGDPB's CC dashboard page, then set the CC's appropriate trigger types, channel and role restrictions. Take note of it's CCID when you added other CCs.
3. Add `initialform.yag`, `buttons 1.yag`, `buttons 2.yag`, `modals.yag`, `collab admin.yag` through YAGDPB's CC dashboard page, then set their appropriate trigger types, channel and role restrictions, for each respective files. Configurables can be changed for each of the files as well.
