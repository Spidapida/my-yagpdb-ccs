After that, \u003c@204255221017214977\u003e will create a private thread of which you can browse around the buttons and menus to edit the details of your collab. You can use the newly created thread to send the details of your collaboration ad before copying it when you click \u003c:GDCreators:959953320812879922\u003e `Modify contents of collab`.\n- To attach media to the template, you can use the command `-collabimage`. You can do link or media attachments (separated the links with a space). Up to a total of ten attachments and links can be submitted.\n- - This command can also be used to replace the media in your template. Doing the command without submitting any media erases the submitted media in the form.\n- - \u003c@204255221017214977\u003e can do a simple check if the media embeds successfully, but it is not foolproof. Please check it first by sending a message here, and see if the image link embeds correctly. **Please note that only direct media (image or video) attachments and/or links are supported, so you cannot embed YouTube videos, Twitter/X posts, Tenor GIFs, etc**.\n- - By default, media attachments will be embedded first to your collab ad, then the media links after that. If you want the media links to be embedded first, include `-urlfirst` when using the command.\n- If you are finished, press ‚§¥Ô∏è` Post your collab` to post your collaboration ad.\n- You can edit your collaboration ad after you submitted it. Simply change the details through menus and buttons, then press ‚úèÔ∏è` Edit posted collab`.\n- \u003c@204255221017214977\u003e would sometimes return with \"Interaction error\", which sometimes causes commands to fail.
